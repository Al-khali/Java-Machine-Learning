# Java-Machine-Learning
Simple machine learning library for Java.


For example code on how to use the library, look in the test folder, where there should be test program(s).

### Current Features:
- Feed-forward and backpropagration
- Adam, Adagrad, and SGD optimizers
- Mini-batch gradient descent
- Activation functions such as sigmoid, tanh, softmax, and RELU
- Dropout
- L2 regularization
- Cross entropy + softmax for classification, with one-hot encoding
- Squared error for regression
- Graphing for points and for 2D classification
- MNIST dataset loader
- Save/load weights to/from files
- Drawing GUI for MNIST

### Planned Features (hopefully!):
- Convolution Neural Network
- LSTM Recurrent Neural Network
